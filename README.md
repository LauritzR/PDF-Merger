# PDF-Merger
A python script for concatenating PDFs. Can be used for e-books, lecture slides etc.

## How to use
Put all your PDF files in one directory. <br>
Then simply run `python3 pdf_merger.py`. <br>
You can specify the path to a directory using `-p`. If you don't, the current directory is used.<br>
Use `-t` to sort by time.<br>
Use `-desc`for descending order. <br>
The output will be given as result.pdf in the same directory as pdf_merger.py.
